This process involves natural selection, where organisms with traits advantageous to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to the next generation. This leads to the accumulation of genetic variation over time, allowing for the adaptation of species to their environments.

This problem is a classic example of the sliding window technique, which allows us to efficiently find the solution in linear time.\n\n### Approach\nThe sliding window technique involves maintaining a window that represents the current substring without repeating characters. We will use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to define the window. As we iterate through the string with the `end` pointer, we check if the current character is within the current window. If it is, we move the `start` pointer to the right to exclude the duplicate character. If the character is not in the current window, we update the maximum"

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:\n   - Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window of unique characters.\n   - Maintain a dictionary `char_count` to keep track of the count of each character within the current window.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n   - For each character in the string (represented by `end`), update its count in `char_count`.\n   - If the character's count"

    "answer": "Let’s assume that the building of the wall is done in a straight line, and each man works at the same rate.\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of work done, which is equal to the number of workers multiplied by the time taken. So, Work = Number of Men × Time. Therefore, if I have two scenarios, I can set up the proportion.\n\nFirst scenario: 20 men × 10 days = 200 man-days.\nSecond scenario: 40 men × x days = 40x man-days.\n\nSince the amount of work is the same, 200 = 40x, so x = 5 days. So, the answer is 5 days"

Then, for 4 machines, the total rate is 4r. If each machine takes t hours to produce 1 part, then r = 1/t. So, the total rate is 4*(1/t) = 4/t. The number of parts produced is equal to the total rate multiplied by time, so 4/t * 4 hours = 16/t. But this is equal to the number of parts, which is 4.

Then, use the speed to find the time for the longer distance.\n\nSo, to find speed, I can use the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nSpeed = 300 km / 6 hours.\n\nThat gives me 50 km per hour.\n\nOkay, so the speed is 50 km/h.\n\nNow, to find the time for 600 km, I can rearrange the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTime"

    "answer": "Please answer using the step-by step explanation.\nTo determine the shape with three sides, I need to recall basic geometric properties. A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. Each side is a straight line segment connecting two vertices. Triangles can be classified into different types based on their angles or side lengths, such as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. The key characteristic of a triangle is its three-sided structure, making it a fundamental shape in geometry. Therefore, the shape that has three sides is a triangle.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the shape with three sides, let's analyze the properties of basic geometric shapes.\n\n1. **Triangle**:\n   - **Sides**: A triangle has three straight sides."

At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I guess the trick is in how we interpret the number. Is 777 a three-digit number, or could it be something else? Let me think.\n\nWell, 777 is a three-digit number where each digit is 7. So, if we're talking about the next number after 777, we need to figure out what comes right after it. In the decimal system, which is what we use most often, each digit represents a power of 10. So, the first"
